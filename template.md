# Example Spec - title

## Introduction

A few words about the overall issue being discussed here

Some notes about using this template:

* Your spec should be in markdown syntax

* Please wrap text at 79 columns

* Markdown addons are available for many web browsers so that
  you can easily view your formatted document

* Any section which does not require content can just say "None"

* The filename for this spec should have something to do with the content
  (i.e, `myspec.md` is not a good title)

* Cheatsheet (one of many) for markdown https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

## Problem statement

A detailed description of the problem to be solved or the use
case for a new feature

## Proposed solution

What do you propose as the solution to the problem stated above?

### Alternatives

Brief description of alternate solutions and an explanation of
why they have been rejected or are considered inferior

## Affected Components

What major components are affected? oshinko-rest, oshinko-s2i, oshinko-web, etc.

If the REST API will change as a result of this spec, it should be described here.
A simple description of the endpoint and method should do, along with a JSON
description of the request/response data

## Testing

How will this be testd, unit tests or additional end-to-end tests? Any special
considerations?

## Documentation

How will documentation need to change when this is implemented?
